Hi there and welcome to our Library Management System UPDATE!

In this new update, our Management System is now working through a Database. This allows for more efficient dataflow and storage.

Inside you'll find an all encompassing system allowing you to add books, genres, authors as well as new users.
    Not only can you add them, but you can search for them as well. You can search for specific books, genres, and authors. Or display all of them at once!
    When searching for users, you can search by the user ID or display all user information at once.


The best part is that nothing changes for the user! To utilize this app follow the onscreen messages and input the correct choices as asked.
